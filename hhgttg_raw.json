    "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy",
    "PROLOGUE",
    "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.",
    "Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.",
    "This planet has\u00d1or rather had\u00d1a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.",
    "Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.",
    "And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.",
    "Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.",
    "And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.",
    "And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.",
    "This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.",
    "Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.",
    "This is not her story.",
    "But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.",
    "It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u00d1not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.",
    "Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.",
    "In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor\u00d1of which no Earthman had ever heard either.",
    "Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one\u00d1more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid\u2019s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God\u2019s Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?",
    "In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.",
    "First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don\u2019t Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.",
    "But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply.",
    "It begins with a house.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.",
    "It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland.",
    "Not a remarkable house by any means\u00d1it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.",
    "The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in.",
    "He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable.",
    "He was about thirty as well, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself.",
    "The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.",
    "He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought.",
    "It was, too\u00d1most of his friends worked in advertising.",
    "It hadn\u2019t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build a bypass instead.",
    "At eight o\u2019clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn\u2019t feel very good.",
    "He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.",
    "Toothpaste on the brush\u00d1so.",
    "Scrub.",
    "Shaving mirror\u00d1pointing at the ceiling.",
    "He adjusted it.",
    "For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window.",
    "Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent\u2019s bristles.",
    "He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.",
    "Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee.",
    "Yawn.",
    "The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.",
    "The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.",
    "He stared at it.",
    "\u201cYellow,\u201d he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.",
    "Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another.",
    "He began to suspect that he was hung over.",
    "Why was he hung over?",
    "Had he been drinking the night before?",
    "He supposed that he must have been.",
    "He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. \u201cYellow,\u201d he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.",
    "He stood and thought.",
    "The pub, he thought.",
    "Oh dear, the pub.",
    "He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important.",
    "He\u2019d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people\u2019s faces.",
    "Something about a new bypass he had just found out about.",
    "It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it.",
    "Ridiculous.",
    "He took a swig of water.",
    "It would sort itself out, he\u2019d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.",
    "It would sort itself out.",
    "God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though.",
    "He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror.",
    "He stuck out his tongue. \u201cYellow,\u201d he thought.",
    "The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with.",
    "Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.",
    "Mr.",
    "L.",
    "Prosser was, as they say, only human.",
    "In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended from an ape.",
    "More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council.",
    "Curiously enough, though he didn\u2019t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr.",
    "L.",
    "Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.",
    "He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.",
    "Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job\u00d1which was to see that Arthur Dent\u2019s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.",
    "\u201cCome off it, Mr.",
    "Dent,\u201d, he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t win you know.",
    "You can\u2019t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.\u201d He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn\u2019t do it.",
    "Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see who rusts first.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to accept it,\u201d said Mr.",
    "Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, \u201cthis bypass has got to be built and it\u2019s going to be built!\u201d",
    "\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cwhy\u2019s it going to be built?\u201d",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean, why\u2019s it got to be built?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bypass.",
    "You\u2019ve got to build bypasses.\u201d",
    "Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast.",
    "People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what\u2019s so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get there, and what\u2019s so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there.",
    "They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser wanted to be at point D.",
    "Point D wasn\u2019t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C.",
    "He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.",
    "His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes.",
    "He didn\u2019t know why\u00d1he just liked axes.",
    "He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.",
    "He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each.",
    "Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn\u2019t him.",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser said: \u201cYou were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you know.\u201d",
    "\u201cAppropriate time?\u201d hooted Arthur. \u201cAppropriate time?",
    "The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday.",
    "I asked him if he\u2019d come to clean the windows and he said no he\u2019d come to demolish the house.",
    "He didn\u2019t tell me straight away of course.",
    "Oh no.",
    "First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver.",
    "Then he told me.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut Mr.",
    "Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon.",
    "You hadn\u2019t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you?",
    "I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut the plans were on display . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cOn display?",
    "I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the display department.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith a torch.\u201d",
    "\u201cAh, well the lights had probably gone.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo had the stairs.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut look, you found the notice didn\u2019t you?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cyes I did.",
    "It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard.\u201d",
    "A cloud passed overhead.",
    "It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud.",
    "It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent\u2019s house.",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser frowned at it.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a particularly nice house,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I happen to like it.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll like the bypass.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh shut up,\u201d said Arthur Dent. \u201cShut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you.",
    "You haven\u2019t got a leg to stand on and you know it.\u201d",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent\u2019s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous.",
    "He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Dent,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHello?",
    "Yes?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cSome factual information for you.",
    "Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?\u201d",
    "\u201cHow much?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Mr.",
    "Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.",
    "By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.",
    "Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.",
    "This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society\u00d1with, it must be said, some success.",
    "For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out-of-work actor, which was plausible enough.",
    "He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research.",
    "The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name \u201cFord Prefect\u201d as being nicely inconspicuous.",
    "He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome.",
    "His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples.",
    "His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose.",
    "There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was.",
    "Perhaps it was that his eyes didn\u2019t blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf.",
    "Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.",
    "He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one\u00d1an unruly boozer with some oddish habits.",
    "For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.",
    "Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing.",
    "Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.",
    "\u201cOh, just looking for flying saucers,\u201d he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for.",
    "\u201cGreen ones!\u201d he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks.",
    "Evenings like this usually ended badly.",
    "Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn\u2019t matter that much really.",
    "Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.",
    "The policemen would usually say something like, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you went off home sir?\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m trying to baby, I\u2019m trying to,\u201d is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions.",
    "In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all.",
    "The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.",
    "Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mind-boggingly dull as the Earth.",
    "Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them.",
    "He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.",
    "In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
    "Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur\u2019s house had settled into a steady routine.",
    "It was Arthur\u2019s accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr.",
    "Prosser\u2019s accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers\u2019 accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage.",
    "The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.",
    "The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.",
    "A shadow moved across him again.",
    "\u201cHello Arthur,\u201d said the shadow.",
    "Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him.",
    "\u201cFord!",
    "Hello, how are you?\u201d",
    "\u201cFine,\u201d said Ford, \u201clook, are you busy?\u201d",
    "\u201cAm I busy?\u201d exclaimed Arthur. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they\u2019ll knock my house down if I don\u2019t, but other than that . . . well, no not especially, why?\u201d",
    "They don\u2019t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating.",
    "He said, \u201cGood, is there anywhere we can talk?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d said Arthur Dent.",
    "For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car.",
    "Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk,\u201d he said urgently.",
    "\u201cFine,\u201d said Arthur, \u201ctalk.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd drink,\u201d said Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that we talk and drink.",
    "Now.",
    "We\u2019ll go to the pub in the village.\u201d",
    "He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.",
    "\u201cLook, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d shouted Arthur.",
    "He pointed at Prosser. \u201cThat man wants to knock my house down!\u201d",
    "Ford glanced at him, puzzled.",
    "\u201cWell he can do it while you\u2019re away can\u2019t he?\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t want him to!\u201d",
    "\u201cAh.\u201d",
    "\u201cLook, what\u2019s the matter with you Ford?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cNothing.",
    "Nothing\u2019s the matter.",
    "Listen to me\u00d1I\u2019ve got to tell you the most important thing you\u2019ve ever heard.",
    "I\u2019ve got to tell you now, and I\u2019ve got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut why?\u201d",
    "\u201cBecause you are going to need a very stiff drink.\u201d",
    "Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken.",
    "He didn\u2019t realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.",
    "The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this:",
    "Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them.",
    "Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song \u201cOh don\u2019t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / No, don\u2019t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die / Won\u2019t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit\u201d).",
    "Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent\u00d1who would then have to drink it.",
    "The bottle would then be refilled.",
    "The game would be played again.",
    "And again.",
    "Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.",
    "As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.",
    "Ford Prefect usually played to lose.",
    "Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all.",
    "\u201cBut what about my house? . . .\u201d he asked plaintively.",
    "Ford looked across to Mr.",
    "Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him.",
    "\u201cHe wants to knock your house down?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, he wants to build . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd he can\u2019t because you\u2019re lying in front of the bulldozers?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, and . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure we can come to some arrangement,\u201d said Ford. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d he shouted.",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around.",
    "He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company.",
    "\u201cYes?",
    "Hello?\u201d he called. \u201cHas Mr.",
    "Dent come to his senses yet?\u201d",
    "\u201cCan we for the moment,\u201d called Ford, \u201cassume that he hasn\u2019t?\u201d",
    "\u201cWell?\u201d sighed Mr.",
    "Prosser.",
    "\u201cAnd can we also assume,\u201d said Ford, \u201cthat he\u2019s going to be staying here all day?\u201d",
    "\u201cSo?\u201d",
    "\u201cSo all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?\u201d",
    "\u201cCould be, could be . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cWell, if you\u2019re resigned to doing that anyway, you don\u2019t actually need him to lie here all the time do you?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d said Ford patiently, \u201cactually need him here.\u201d",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser thought about this.",
    "\u201cWell no, not as such . . .\u201d, he said, \u201cnot exactly need . . .\u201d Prosser was worried.",
    "He thought that one of them wasn\u2019t making a lot of sense.",
    "Ford said, \u201cSo if you would just like to take it as read that he\u2019s actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour.",
    "How does that sound?\u201d",
    "Mr.",
    "Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.",
    "\u201cThat sounds perfectly reasonable,\u201d he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure.",
    "\u201cAnd if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on,\u201d said Ford, \u201cwe can always cover up for you in return.\u201d",
    "\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said Mr.",
    "Prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all, \u201cthank you very much, yes, that\u2019s very kind . . .\u201d He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head.",
    "He could only assume that he had just won.",
    "\u201cSo,\u201d continued Ford Prefect, \u201cif you would just like to come over here and lie down . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mr.",
    "Prosser.",
    "\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Ford, \u201cperhaps I hadn\u2019t made myself fully clear.",

    "\u201cThis must be Thursday,\u201d said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, \u201cI never could get the hang of Thursdays.\u201d",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slab-like somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.",
    "They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.",
    "The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment.",
    "The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them\u00d1which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they\u2019d been looking for all these years.",
    "The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself.",
    "It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck.",
    "The contents of Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist\u2019s eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.",
    "Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb\u00d1a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.",
    "This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million \u201cpages\u201d could be summoned at a moment\u2019s notice.",
    "It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don\u2019t Panic printed on it in large friendly letters.",
    "The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor\u00d1The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
    "The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.",
    "Beneath that in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.",
    "The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.",
    "A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have.",
    "Partly it has great practical value\u00d1you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can\u2019t see it, it can\u2019t see you\u00d1daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.",
    "More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.",
    "For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc.",
    "Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have \u201clost\u201d.",
    "What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.",
    "Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in \u201cHey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect?",
    "There\u2019s a frood who really knows where his towel is.\u201d (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.)",
    "Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly.",
    "Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out.",
    "At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.",
    "\u201cYou got a towel with you?\u201d said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.",
    "Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.",
    "\u201cWhy?",
    "What, no . . . should I have?\u201d He had given up being surprised, there didn\u2019t seem to be any point any longer.",
    "Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.",
    "\u201cDrink up,\u201d he urged.",
    "At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.",
    "Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he yelped.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Ford, \u201cthey haven\u2019t started yet.\u201d",
    "\u201cThank God for that,\u201d said Arthur and relaxed.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s probably just your house being knocked down,\u201d said Ford, drowning his last pint.",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d shouted Arthur.",
    "Suddenly Ford\u2019s spell was broken.",
    "Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window.",
    "\u201cMy God they are!",
    "They\u2019re knocking my house down.",
    "What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt hardly makes any difference at this stage,\u201d said Ford, \u201clet them have their fun.\u201d",
    "\u201cFun?\u201d yelped Arthur. \u201cFun!\u201d He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing.",
    "\u201cDamn their fun!\u201d he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass.",
    "He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.",
    "\u201cStop, you vandals!",
    "You home wreckers!\u201d bawled Arthur. \u201cYou half-crazed Visigoths, stop will you!\u201d",
    "Ford would have to go after him.",
    "Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts.",
    "\u201cThere you are sir,\u201d said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, \u201ctwenty-eight pence if you\u2019d be so kind.\u201d",
    "Ford was very kind\u00d1he gave the barman another five-pound note and told him to keep the change.",
    "The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.",
    "He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn\u2019t understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before.",
    "In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal.",
    "This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth.",
    "On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn\u2019t very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed.",
    "Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse.",
    "The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance.",
    "He didn\u2019t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe.",
    "\u201cAre you serious, sir?\u201d he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. \u201cYou think the world\u2019s going to end?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cBut, this afternoon?\u201d",
    "Ford had recovered himself.",
    "He was at his flippest.",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d he said gaily, \u201cin less than two minutes I would estimate.\u201d",
    "The barman couldn\u2019t believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn\u2019t believe the sensation he had just had either.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything we can do about it then?\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.",
    "Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become.",
    "The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now.",
    "His eyes waved their way up to Ford.",
    "\u201cI thought,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you like, yes,\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what they told us in the army,\u201d said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back down to his whisky.",
    "\u201cWill that help?\u201d asked the barman.",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d With a wave, he left.",
    "The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again.",
    "The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.",
    "However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it.",
    "The barman cleared his throat.",
    "He heard himself say:",
    "\u201cLast orders, please.\u201d",
    "\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00c7\u00c8\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00c7\u00c8\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1\u00c7\u00c8\u00d1\u00d1\u00d1",
    "The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster.",
    "Ford knew they were there.",
    "This wasn\u2019t the way he had wanted it.",
    "Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house.",
    "He didn\u2019t notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn\u2019t notice the wind, he didn\u2019t notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.",
    "He didn\u2019t notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.",
    "\u201cYou barbarians!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019ll sue the council for every penny it\u2019s got!",
    "I\u2019ll have you hung, drawn and quartered!",
    "And whipped!",
    "And boiled . . . until . . . until . . . until you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d",
    "Ford was running after him very fast.",
    "Very very fast.",
    "\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll do it again!\u201d yelled Arthur. \u201cAnd when I\u2019ve finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!\u201d",
    "Arthur didn\u2019t notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn\u2019t notice that Mr.",
    "Prosser was staring hectically into the sky.",
    "What Mr.",
    "Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.",
    "Impossibly huge yellow somethings.",
    "\u201cAnd I will carry on jumping on them,\u201d yelled Arthur, still running, \u201cuntil I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then . . .\u201d",
    "Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back.",
    "At last he noticed that something was going on.",
    "His finger shot upwards.",
    "\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that?\u201d he shrieked.",
    "Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull.",
    "Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.",
    "It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing themselves.",
    "None of it made a lot of sense\u00d1running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise.",
    "All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.",
    "Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears.",
    "He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start.",
    "It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart.",
    "Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn\u2019t it just have to be the Vogons.",
    "Still he knew what he had to do.",
    "As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel.",
    "He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn\u2019t need them where he was going.",
    "Everything was ready, everything was prepared.",
    "He knew where his towel was.",
    "A sudden silence hit the Earth.",
    "If anything it was worse than the noise.",
    "For a while nothing happened.",
    "The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth.",
    "Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature.",
    "Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at.",
    "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don\u2019t.",
    "And still nothing happened.",
    "Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound.",
    "Every hi fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on.",
    "Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board.",
    "Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built.",
    "But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.",
    "\u201cPeople of Earth, your attention please,\u201d a voice said, and it was wonderful.",
    "Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.",
    "\u201cThis is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council,\u201d the voice continued. \u201cAs you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.",
    "The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes.",
    "Thank you.\u201d",
    "The PA died away.",
    "Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.",
    "The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them.",
    "Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to.",
    "Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again.",
    "It said:",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no point in acting all surprised about it.",
    "All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you\u2019ve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it\u2019s far too late to start making a fuss about it now.\u201d",
    "The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land.",
    "The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power.",
    "On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.",
    "By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet.",
    "Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply.",
    "The PA slammed back into life again.",
    "The voice was annoyed.",

    "Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun.",
    "Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of.",
    "Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.",
    "The boat sped on across the water.",
    "It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet.",
    "It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.",
    "The boat sped on.",
    "Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet.",
    "This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.",
    "The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence\u00d1in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France.",
    "One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences.",
    "But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marveling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
    "It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy\u00d1Zaphod Beeblebrox?",
    "President?",
    "Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox?",
    "Not the President?",
    "Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.",
    "Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.",
    "President?",
    "No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.",
    "Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder.",
    "[President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government.",
    "The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism.",
    "The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries.",
    "In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness.",
    "All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the Emperor\u00d1an elected Governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly.",
    "In fact it vests in no such place.",
    "The President in particular is very much a figurehead\u00d1he wields no real power whatsoever.",
    "He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage.",
    "For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character.",
    "His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.",
    "On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had\u00d1he has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud.",
    "Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.",
    "Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer.",
    "They couldn\u2019t be more wrong.]",
    "What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.",
    "He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.",
    "Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to.",
    "Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s Presidency was all about.",
    "Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.",
    "As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be.",
    "He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back.",
    "He steered with an extra arm he\u2019d recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.",
    "\u201cHey,\u201d he cooed to himself, \u201cyou\u2019re a real cool boy you.\u201d But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.",
    "The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent-shaped.",
    "In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay.",
    "This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs.",
    "From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore.",
    "On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.",
    "It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold\u00d1mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue).",
    "All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free-standing prism for the occasion.",
    "There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them.",
    "Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they\u2019d known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all.",
    "Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.",
    "The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seamanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay.",
    "It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns.",
    "In fact it didn\u2019t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms\u00d1but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water.",
    "They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat\u2019s wake as it careered across the bay.",
    "Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.",
    "He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.",
    "Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people.",
    "The three billion people weren\u2019t actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby.",
    "The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that\u2019s what they were for.",
    "He grinned again.",
    "Three billion and six people didn\u2019t know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.",
    "The robot camera homed in for a close-up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again.",
    "He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm.",
    "His fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven.",
    "A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun.",
    "Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock.",
    "Again, all done for effect as much as anything.",
    "Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa.",
    "He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee.",
    "His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up.",
    "At any moment, he thought, he might scream.",
    "Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted.",
    "The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout.",
    "Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff.",
    "Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.",
    "Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.",
    "A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.",
    "At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt.",
    "To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.",
    "The President of the Galaxy had arrived.",
    "He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting.",
    "\u201cHi,\u201d he said.",
    "A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands.",
    "Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay.",
    "Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented.",
    "It was constructed largely of papier-m\u2030ch\u017d and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it.",
    "The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.",
    "\u201cHi,\u201d he said again.",
    "Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone.",
    "He singled out Trillian from the crowd.",
    "Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito.",
    "She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes.",
    "With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic.",
    "Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course.",
    "The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran.",
    "Trillian wasn\u2019t anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed.",
    "She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him.",
    "\u201cHi honey,\u201d he said to her.",
    "She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away.",
    "Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly\u00d1but by this time he was looking at something else.",
    "\u201cHi,\u201d he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes.",
    "He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote.",
    "The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them.",
    "One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket.",
    "Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground.",
    "Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way.",
    "Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mind-boggingly beautiful.",
    "At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named\u00d1The Heart of Gold.",
    "\u201cWow\u201d, said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold.",
    "There wasn\u2019t much else he could say.",
    "He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.",
    "\u201cWow.\u201d",
    "The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly.",
    "He winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him.",
    "She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff.",
    "\u201cThat is really amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really is truly amazing.",
    "That is so amazingly amazing I think I\u2019d like to steal it.\u201d",
    "A marvelous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form.",
    "The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned.",
    "As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.",
    "Finally he could bear it no more.",
    "He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons.",
    "His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead.",
    "His dark-green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.",
    "Not that he ever went swimming of course.",
    "His busy schedule would not allow it.",
    "He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet\u2019s virgin shores . . . when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake.",
    "They never evolved again; they should never have survived.",
    "The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures.",
    "Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery.",
    "Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder.",
    "They brought forth scintillating jeweled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on.",
    "They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway.",
    "Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel.",
    "Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service.",
    "They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears.",
    "Every year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jeweled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets.",
    "Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile.",
    "Also, he did not like hitch hikers.",
    "Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz\u2019s flagship, a small match flared nervously.",
    "The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous.",
    "His name was Ford Prefect*.",
    "[Ford Prefect\u2019s original name is only pronounceable in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven.",
    "Ford\u2019s father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain.",
    "The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly.",
    "Ford\u2019s father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now-dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.",
    "Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy.",
    "The other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as \u201cboy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven\u201d.]",
    "He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet.",
    "He breathed a silent thank-you to the Dentrassis.",
    "The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long-haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves.",
    "This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves.",
    "The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.",
    "It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.",
    "He heard a slight groan.",
    "By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor.",
    "Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out.",
    "He crouched on the floor.",
    "The shape moved again.",
    "Ford Prefect said: \u201cI bought some peanuts.\u201d",
    "Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.",
    "\u201cHere, have some,\u201d urged Ford, shaking the packet again, \u201cif you\u2019ve never been through a matter transference beam before you\u2019ve probably lost some salt and protein.",
    "The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhhhrrrr . . .\u201d said Arthur Dent.",
    "He opened his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cNo light,\u201d said Arthur Dent. \u201cDark, no light.\u201d",
    "One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious, as in It\u2019s a nice day, or You\u2019re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright?",
    "At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour.",
    "If human beings don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.",
    "After a few months\u2019 consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one.",
    "If they don\u2019t keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.",
    "After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn\u2019t know about.",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed with Arthur, \u201cno light.\u201d He helped Arthur to some peanuts. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cLike a military academy,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cbits of me keep on passing out.\u201d",
    "Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.",
    "\u201cIf I asked you where the hell we were,\u201d said Arthur weakly, \u201cwould I regret it?\u201d",
    "Ford stood up. \u201cWe\u2019re safe,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOh good,\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re in a small galley cabin,\u201d said Ford, \u201cin one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.\u201d",
    "\u201cAh,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cthis is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn\u2019t previously aware of.\u201d",

    "Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again.",
    "Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively.",
    "Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.",
    "\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d he asked, shivering slightly.",
    "\u201cWe hitched a lift,\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Arthur. \u201cAre you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in.",
    "I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?\u201d",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d said Ford, \u201cthe Thumb\u2019s an electronic sub-etha signalling device, the roundabout\u2019s at Barnard\u2019s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that\u2019s more or less right.\u201d",

    "\u201cNo, I think if it\u2019s all the same to you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d",

    "Another thing they couldn\u2019t stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible.",
    "Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way:",
    "If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability.",
    "So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea . . . and turn it on!",
    "He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air.",
    "It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute\u2019s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn\u2019t stand was a smartass.",

    "In fact it wasn\u2019t perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes.",
    "The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three-dimensional oblong room, but then the designers would have got miserable.",

    "Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax-free.",
    "Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space.",
    "In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.",
    "And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before\u00d1and thus was the Empire forged.",
    "Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor\u00d1at least no one worth speaking of.",
    "And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they\u2019d settled on\u00d1none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn\u2019t quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.",
    "And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building.",
    "The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets\u00d1gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes\u00d1all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy\u2019s richest men naturally came to expect.",
    "But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty.",
    "And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned political economy.",
    "Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend.",
    "In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it.",

    "The moment carried itself.",
    "Even the most seasoned star tramp can\u2019t help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy.",
    "Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light.",
    "It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire.",
    "Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them.",
    "\u201cThe fires of dawn! . . .\u201d breathed Zaphod. \u201cThe twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm! . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cOr whatever,\u201d said Ford quietly.",
    "\u201cSoulianis and Rahm!\u201d insisted Zaphod.",
    "The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much.",
    "As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was.",
    "It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him.",
    "All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile.",
    "Isn\u2019t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?",
    "All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur.",
    "He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on.",
    "\u201cI only know what Zaphod\u2019s told me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cApparently Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in.",
    "Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets.\u201d",
    "Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important.",
    "Suddenly he realized what it was.",
    "\u201cIs there any tea on this spaceship?\u201d he asked.",
    "More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path.",
    "The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day\u00d1grey, dusty and only dimly contoured.",
    "It looked dead and cold as a crypt.",
    "From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon\u00d1ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities\u00d1but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire.",
    "The planet\u2019s surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.",
    "Clearly, it was very very old.",
    "A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them.",
    "The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence.",

    "\u201cAlright, just supposing there\u2019s something.",
    "I take it you\u2019re not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all.",
    "What are you after?\u201d",
    "One of Zaphod\u2019s heads looked away.",
    "The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn\u2019t looking at anything very much.",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d said Zaphod airily, \u201cit\u2019s partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it\u2019s the fame and the money . . .\u201d",
    "Ford glanced at him sharply.",
    "He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn\u2019t the faintest idea why he was there at all.",
    "\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like the look of that planet at all,\u201d said Trillian shivering.",
    "\u201cAh, take no notice,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cwith half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy.\u201d",
    "Bullshit, thought Ford.",
    "Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now.",
    "He shrugged.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s just a dead planet,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe suspense is killing me,\u201d said Arthur testily.",
    "Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance.",
    "The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.",
    "The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defense system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a mice cage, the bruising of somebody\u2019s upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale.",
    "In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise.",
    "This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur\u2019s mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shell-shocked fragments the previous day had left him with.",
    "He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
    "The way it functioned was very interesting.",
    "When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject\u2019s taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject\u2019s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centers of the subject\u2019s brain to see what was likely to go down well.",
    "However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
    "The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau star system.",
    "Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving.",
    "He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past.",
    "It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him.",
    "\u201cIs it safe?\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cMagrathea\u2019s been dead for five million years,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cof course it\u2019s safe.",
    "Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now.\u201d At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge\u00d1a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound.",
    "It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial.",
    "The voice said \u201cGreetings to you . . .\u201d",
    "Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.",
    "\u201cComputer!\u201d shouted Zaphod.",
    "\u201cHi there!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat the photon is it?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh, just some five-million-year-old tape that\u2019s being broadcast at us.\u201d",
    "\u201cA what?",
    "A recording?\u201d",
    "\u201cShush!\u201d said Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s carrying on.\u201d",
    "The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace.",
    "\u201cThis is a recorded announcement,\u201d it said, \u201cas I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re all out at the moment.",
    "The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit . . .\u201d",
    "(\u201dA voice from ancient Magrathea!\u201d shouted Zaphod. \u201cOK, OK,\u201d said Ford.)",
    "\u201c. . . but regrets,\u201d continued the voice, \u201cthat the entire planet is temporarily closed for business.",
    "Thank you.",
    "If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone.\u201d",
    "A short buzz followed, then silence.",
    "\u201cThey want to get rid of us,\u201d said Trillian nervously. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just a recording,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cWe keep going.",
    "Got that, computer?\u201d",
    "\u201cI got it,\u201d said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed.",
    "They waited.",
    "After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice.",
    "\u201cWe would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that\u2019s best in contemporary geography.\u201d The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. \u201cMeanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave.",
    "Now.\u201d",
    "Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.",
    "\u201cWell, I suppose we\u2019d better be going then, hadn\u2019t we?\u201d he suggested.",
    "\u201cShhh!\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing to be worried about.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen why\u2019s everyone so tense?\u201d",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re just interested!\u201d shouted Zaphod. \u201cComputer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing.\u201d",
    "This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly cold.",
    "\u201cIt is most gratifying,\u201d it said, \u201cthat your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail.",
    "We look forward to your custom in future lives . . . thank you.\u201d",
    "The voice snapped off.",
    "\u201cOh,\u201d said Trillian.",
    "\u201cEr . . .\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cWell?\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cwill you get it into your heads?",
    "That\u2019s just a recorded message.",
    "It\u2019s millions of years old.",
    "It doesn\u2019t apply to us, get it?\u201d",

    "Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen.",
    "Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship.",
    "A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus\u00d1two massively real rockets thundering through the sky.",
    "The suddenness of it was shocking.",
    "\u201cI think they\u2019re going to have a very good try at applying to us,\u201d said Ford.",

    "\u201cHow soon can we get off it?\u201d",
    "Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger.",

    "\u201cNo, we\u2019re also going to . . . er . . . take evasive action!\u201d said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic. \u201cComputer, what evasive action can we take?\u201d",
    "\u201cEr, none I\u2019m afraid, guys,\u201d said the computer.",

    "Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax.\u201d",
    "Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously. \u201cRight!\u201d he said. \u201cEr . . . we\u2019ve got to get manual control of this ship.\u201d",
    "\u201cCan you fly her?\u201d asked Ford pleasantly.",
    "\u201cNo, can you?\u201d",

    "\u201cNo.\u201d",

    "\u201cI can\u2019t either,\u201d said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d guessed that,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cOK computer, I want full manual control now.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou got it,\u201d said the computer.",
    "Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these controls had never been used before.",
    "Zaphod stared at them wildly.",
    "\u201cOK, Ford,\u201d he said, \u201cfull retro thrust and ten degrees starboard.",
    "Or something . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cGood luck guys,\u201d chirped the computer, \u201cimpact minus thirty seconds . . .\u201d",
    "Ford leapt to the controls\u00d1only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those.",
    "The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocket jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously.",
    "He released half of them and the ship spun round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles.",
    "Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them.",
    "For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move.",
    "Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system.",
    "The lever snapped off.",
    "The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards.",
    "The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin.",
    "Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought-after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone.",
    "It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm.",
    "This should be emphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship.",
    "The safety of the crew is absolutely assured.",

    "\u201cThen turn the bloody engines back on!\u201d bawled Zaphod.",
    "\u201cOK, sure thing, guys,\u201d said the computer.",
    "With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again.",

    "The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems.",
    "\u201cAt the end of the storm . . .\u201d crooned Eddie.",
    "The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship.",
    "\u201c. . . is a golden sky . . .\u201d",
    "But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it.",

    "\u201cWhat, are you crazy?\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cWithout proper programming anything could happen.\u201d",
    "\u201cDoes that matter at this stage?\u201d shouted Arthur.",
    "\u201cThough your dreams be tossed and blown . . .\u201d sand Eddie.",

    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior.",
    "It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue.",
    "In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal.",
    "Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden.",
    "Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs.",
    "As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands.",
    "Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from.",
    "It was in fact sensationally beautiful.",
    "Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d",
    "\u201cWell I was just saying,\u201d said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, \u201cthere\u2019s this Improbability Drive switch over here . . .\u201d he waved at where it had been.",
    "There was a potted plant there now.",
    "\u201cBut where are we?\u201d said Ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand.",
    "\u201cExactly where we were, I think . . .\u201d said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.",
    "Zaphod leapt out of his seat.",
    "\u201cThen what\u2019s happened to the missiles?\u201d he said.",
    "A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.",
    "\u201cThey would appear,\u201d said Ford doubtfully, \u201cto have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised-looking whale . . .\u201d",

    "\u201cWell,\u201d said Arthur, \u201call I did was . . .\u201d",

    "Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.",
    "And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.",
    "This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it.",
    "Ah! . . .",

    "What do I mean by who am I?",

    "It\u2019s a sort of . . . yawning, tingling sensation in my . . . my . . . well I suppose I\u2019d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let\u2019s call it my stomach.",
    "Good.",
    "Ooooh, it\u2019s getting quite strong.",
    "And hey, what\u2019s about this whistling roaring sound going past what I\u2019m suddenly going to call my head?",
    "Perhaps I can call that . . . wind!",
    "Is that a good name?",
    "It\u2019ll do . . . perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s for.",
    "It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it.",
    "Hey!",
    "What\u2019s this thing?",
    "This . . . let\u2019s call it a tail\u00d1yeah, tail.",
    "Hey!",
    "I can really thrash it about pretty good can\u2019t I?",
    "Wow!",
    "Wow!",
    "That feels great!",
    "Doesn\u2019t seem to achieve very much but I\u2019ll probably find out what it\u2019s for later on.",
    "Now\u00d1have I built up any coherent picture of things yet?",
    "No.",
    "Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I\u2019m quite dizzy with anticipation . . .",
    "Or is it the wind?",
    "There really is a lot of that now isn\u2019t it?",
    "And wow!",
    "Hey!",
    "What\u2019s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast?",
    "Very very fast.",
    "So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide-sounding name like . . . ow . . . ound . . . round . . . ground!",
    "That\u2019s it!",
    "That\u2019s a good name\u00d1ground!",
    "I wonder if it will be friends with me?",
    "And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.",
    "Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again.",
    "Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.",

    "Unknown",
    "\u201cAre we taking this robot with us?\u201d said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree.",

    "\u201cOh, the Paranoid Android,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll take him.\u201d",

    "They looked at each other in puzzlement.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the computer,\u201d explained Zaphod. \u201cI discovered it had an emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out better.\u201d",
    "\u201cNow this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet,\u201d continued Eddie\u2019s new voice, \u201cso I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters.\u201d",
    "Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch.",

    "\u201cWill you open the exit hatch please, computer?\u201d said Zaphod trying not to get angry.",
    "\u201cNot until whoever said that owns up,\u201d urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed.",
    "\u201cOh God,\u201d muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten.",
    "He was desperately worried that one day sentient life forms would forget how to do this.",

    "\u201cComputer . . .\u201d said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, \u201cif you don\u2019t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?\u201d",
    "Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this.",
    "Ford carried on counting quietly.",
    "This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood . . . blood . . . blood . . . blood . . .",
    "Finally Eddie said quietly, \u201cI can see this relationship is something we\u2019re all going to have to work at,\u201d and the hatchway opened.",

    "It was very cold.",
    "Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it.",
    "He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground.",
    "The wind stung Arthur\u2019s eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat.",
    "However, the thing stung most was his mind.",

    "Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere.",
    "\u201cDesolate hole if you ask me,\u201d said Ford. \u201cI could have more fun in a cat litter.\u201d He felt a mounting irritation.",
    "Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy\u00d1didn\u2019t he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway?",
    "Not even a hot dog stand in evidence.",

    "Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned.",
    "She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them.",
    "She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him.",
    "He seemed to be excited, but they couldn\u2019t clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind.",
    "As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular\u00d1a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide.",
    "Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red lumps.",
    "They stopped and looked at a piece.",
    "It was wet.",
    "It was rubbery.",
    "With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.",

    "\u201cLook,\u201d he said, pointing into the crater.",
    "In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn\u2019t lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot.",

    "Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid.",
    "At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics\u00d1simple angular patterns in bright colours.",
    "Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them.",
    "She called to Zaphod.",
    "\u201cHey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?\u201d",
    "\u201cI think they\u2019re just strange symbols of some kind,\u201d said Zaphod, hardly glancing back.",
    "Trillian shrugged and hurried after him.",
    "From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment.",
    "He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look.",
    "Trillian followed.",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d said Ford, \u201cyou reckon this is Magrathea . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cand we heard the voice, right?\u201d",
    "\u201cOK, so I\u2019ve bought the fact that it\u2019s Magrathea\u00d1for the moment.",
    "What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it.",
    "You didn\u2019t just look it up in a star atlas, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d",
    "\u201cResearch.",
    "Government archives.",
    "Detective work.",
    "Few lucky guesses.",
    "Easy.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?\u201d",
    "\u201cI stole it to look for a lot of things.\u201d",
    "\u201cA lot of things?\u201d said Ford in surprise. \u201cLike what?\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy not?\u201d",
    "\u201cBecause . . . because . . .",
    "I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to look for them.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat, are you crazy?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility I haven\u2019t ruled out yet,\u201d said Zaphod quietly. \u201cI only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions.",
    "And its current conditions are not good.\u201d",
    "For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry.",
    "\u201cListen old friend, if you want to . . .\u201d started Ford eventually.",
    "\u201cNo, wait . . .",
    "I\u2019ll tell you something,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cI freewheel a lot.",
    "I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it.",
    "I reckon I\u2019ll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it\u2019s easy.",
    "I decide to steal this ship.",
    "I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens.",
    "Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out.",
    "It\u2019s like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques.",
    "And then whenever I stop and think\u00d1why did I want to do something?\u00d1how did I work out how to do it?\u00d1I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.",
    "Like I have now.",
    "It\u2019s a big effort to talk about it.\u201d",
    "Zaphod paused for a while.",
    "For a while there was silence.",
    "Then he frowned and said, \u201cLast night I was worrying about this again.",
    "About the fact that part of my mind just didn\u2019t seem to work properly.",
    "Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it.",
    "I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn\u2019t use it.",
    "I wondered if there was a way I could check.",
    "\u201cI went to the ship\u2019s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephalographic screen.",
    "I went through every major screening test on both my heads\u00d1all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency could be properly ratified.",
    "They showed up nothing.",
    "Nothing unexpected at least.",
    "They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn\u2019t have guessed.",
    "And no other anomalies.",
    "So I started inventing further tests, completely at random.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head.",
    "Still nothing.",
    "Finally I got silly, because I\u2019d given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia.",
    "Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter.",
    "You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when I was a kid?",
    "I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?\u201d",
    "Ford nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd there it was,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cclear as day.",
    "A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them.",
    "Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum.\u201d",
    "Ford stared at him, aghast.",
    "Trillian had turned white.",
    "\u201cSomebody did that to you?\u201d whispered Ford.",
    "\u201cYeah.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut have you any idea who?",
    "Or why?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy?",
    "I can only guess.",
    "But I do know who the bastard was.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou know?",
    "How do you know?\u201d",
    "\u201cBecause they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses.",
    "They left them there for me to see.\u201d",
    "Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl.",
    "\u201cInitials?",
    "Burnt into your brain?\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah.\u201d",
    "\u201cWell, what were they, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d",
    "Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment.",
    "Then he looked away.",
    "\u201cZ.B.,\u201d he said.",
    "At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it later,\u201d choked Zaphod as all three passed out.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.",
    "Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with.",
    "He pushed a few buttons at random.",
    "The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time.",
    "One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he\u2019d bought over the past few years.",
    "There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centers of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time.",
    "Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.",
    "And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.",
    "And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public.",
    "When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.",
    "There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s highly profitable second-hand biro business.",
    "Arthur read this, and put the book down.",
    "The robot still sat there, completely inert.",
    "Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater.",
    "He walked around the crater.",
    "He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea.",
    "He went back down into the crater.",
    "He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.",
    "\u201cNight\u2019s falling,\u201d he said. \u201cLook robot, the stars are coming out.\u201d",
    "From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen.",
    "The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back.",
    "\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cWretched isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
    "\u201cBut that sunset!",
    "I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams . . . the two suns!",
    "It was like mountains of fire boiling into space.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cIt\u2019s rubbish.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe only ever had the one sun at home,\u201d persevered Arthur, \u201cI came from a planet called Earth you know.\u201d",
    "\u201cI know,\u201d said Marvin, \u201cyou keep going on about it.",
    "It sounds awful.\u201d",
    "\u201cAh no, it was a beautiful place.\u201d",
    "\u201cDid it have oceans?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Arthur with a sigh, \u201cgreat wide rolling blue oceans . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cCan\u2019t bear oceans,\u201d said Marvin.",
    "\u201cTell me,\u201d inquired Arthur, \u201cdo you get on well with other robots?\u201d",
    "\u201cHate them,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d",
    "Arthur couldn\u2019t bear any more.",
    "He had got up again.",
    "\u201cI think I\u2019ll just take another walk,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t blame you,\u201d said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.",
    "Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job.",
    "He trudged back up the wall of the crater.",
    "Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark.",
    "Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon.",
    "He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe.",
    "When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with.",
    "But he didn\u2019t turn yet, not even to react to Arthur\u2019s yelp of surprise.",
    "Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned.",
    "His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind\u00d1a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed.",
    "It shed a dim pool of light around it.",
    "The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.",
    "\u201cYou choose a cold night to visit our dead planet,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWho . . . who are you?\u201d stammered Arthur.",
    "The man looked away.",
    "Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face.",
    "\u201cMy name is not important,\u201d he said.",
    "He seemed to have something on his mind.",
    "Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn\u2019t have to rush at.",
    "Arthur felt awkward.",
    "\u201cI . . . er . . . you startled me . . .\u201d he said, lamely.",
    "The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u201cHmmmm?\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI said you startled me.\u201d",
    "\u201cDo not be alarmed, I will not harm you.\u201d",
    "Arthur frowned at him. \u201cBut you shot at us!",
    "There were missiles . . .\u201d he said.",
    "The man chuckled slightly.",
    "\u201cAn automatic system,\u201d he said and gave a small sigh. \u201cAncient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks.",
    "I think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony.\u201d",
    "He looked gravely at Arthur and said, \u201cI\u2019m a great fan of science you know.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh . . . er, really?\u201d said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man\u2019s curious, kindly manner disconcerting.",
    "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.",
    "\u201cAh,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cer . . .\u201d He had an odd feeling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman\u2019s husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again.",
    "\u201cYou seem ill at ease,\u201d said the old man with polite concern.",
    "\u201cEr, no . . . well, yes.",
    "Actually you see, we weren\u2019t really expecting to find anybody about in fact.",
    "I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cDead?\u201d said the old man. \u201cGood gracious no, we have but slept.\u201d",
    "\u201cSlept?\u201d said Arthur incredulously.",
    "\u201cYes, through the economic recession you see,\u201d said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not.",
    "\u201cEr, economic recession?\u201d",
    "\u201cWell you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see . . .\u201d",
    "He paused and looked at Arthur.",
    "\u201cYou know we built planets do you?\u201d he asked solemnly.",
    "\u201cWell yes,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cI\u2019d sort of gathered . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cFascinating trade,\u201d said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, \u201cdoing the coastlines was always my favourite.",
    "Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords . . . so anyway,\u201d he said trying to find his thread again, \u201cthe recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it.",
    "So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over.\u201d",
    "The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued.",
    "\u201cThe computers were index-linked to the Galactic stock market prices you see, so that we\u2019d all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services.\u201d",
    "Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
    "\u201cIs it?\u201d asked the old man mildly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a bit out of touch.\u201d",
    "He pointed down into the crater.",
    "\u201cIs that robot yours?\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d came a thin metallic voice from the crater, \u201cI\u2019m mine.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019d call it a robot,\u201d muttered Arthur. \u201cIt\u2019s more a sort of electronic sulking machine.\u201d",
    "\u201cBring it,\u201d said the old man.",
    "Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man\u2019s voice.",
    "He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn\u2019t.",
    "\u201cOn second thoughts,\u201d said the old man, \u201cleave it here.",
    "You must come with me.",
    "Great things are afoot.\u201d He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark.",
    "Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself.",
    "\u201cCome,\u201d called the old man, \u201ccome now or you will be late.\u201d",
    "\u201cLate?\u201d said Arthur. \u201cWhat for?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat is your name, human?\u201d",
    "\u201cDent.",
    "Arthur Dent,\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cLate, as in the late Dentarthurdent,\u201d said the old man, sternly. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of threat you see.\u201d Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been very good at them myself, but I\u2019m told they can be very effective.\u201d",
    "Arthur blinked at him.",
    "\u201cWhat an extraordinary person,\u201d he muttered to himself.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said the old man.",
    "\u201cOh nothing, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Arthur in embarrassment. \u201cAlright, where do we go?\u201d",
    "\u201cIn my aircar,\u201d said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them. \u201cWe are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five-million-year slumber.",
    "Magrathea awakes.\u201d",
    "Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man.",
    "The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him.",
    "He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel.",
    "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said to him, \u201cwhat is your name by the way?\u201d",
    "\u201cMy name?\u201d said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again.",
    "He paused. \u201cMy name,\u201d he said, \u201c. . . is Slartibartfast.\u201d",
    "Arthur practically choked.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d he spluttered.",
    "\u201cSlartibartfast,\u201d repeated the old man quietly.",
    "\u201cSlartibartfast?\u201d",
    "The old man looked at him gravely. \u201cI said it wasn\u2019t important,\u201d he said.",
    "The aircar sailed through the night.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.",
    "For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much\u00d1the wheel, New York, wars and so on\u00d1whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.",
    "But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man\u00d1for precisely the same reasons.",
    "Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.",
    "The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d, but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.",
    "In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man.",
    "The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures\u2019 plans.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night.",
    "It sped swiftly.",
    "Arthur\u2019s companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that.",
    "Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points.",
    "The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.",
    "Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be.",
    "He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course.",
    "Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over.",
    "The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him.",
    "He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened.",
    "They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground.",
    "The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel.",
    "The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour.",
    "He closed his eyes in terror.",
    "After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt.",
    "He opened his eyes again.",
    "They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels.",
    "When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel.",
    "Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light.",
    "It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was.",
    "Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultraviolet.",
    "Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.",
    "\u201cEarthman,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are now deep in the heart of Magrathea.\u201d",
    "\u201cHow did you know I was an Earthman?\u201d demanded Arthur.",
    "\u201cThese things will become clear to you,\u201d said the old man gently, \u201cat least,\u201d he added with slight doubt in his voice, \u201cclearer than they are at the moment.\u201d",
    "He continued: \u201cI should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet.",
    "It is a little too . . . large.",
    "We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace.",
    "It may disturb you.\u201d",
    "Arthur made nervous noises.",
    "Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. \u201cIt scares the willies out of me.",
    "Hold tight.\u201d",
    "The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like.",
    "It wasn\u2019t infinity in fact.",
    "Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting.",
    "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity\u00d1distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.",
    "The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.",
    "Arthur\u2019s senses bobbed and spun, as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them.",
    "The wall.",
    "The wall defied the imagination\u00d1seduced it and defeated it.",
    "The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight.",
    "The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man.",
    "The wall appeared perfectly flat.",
    "It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved.",
    "It met itself again thirteen light seconds away.",
    "In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light.",
    "\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mind-boggling space, \u201cwelcome,\u201d he said, \u201cto our factory floor.\u201d",
    "Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror.",
    "Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space.",
    "\u201cThis,\u201d said Slartibartfast, \u201cis where we make most of our planets you see.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou mean,\u201d said Arthur, trying to form the words, \u201cyou mean you\u2019re starting it all up again now?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo no, good heavens no,\u201d exclaimed the old man, \u201cno, the Galaxy isn\u2019t nearly rich enough to support us yet.",
    "No, we\u2019ve been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very . . . special clients from another dimension.",
    "It may interest you . . . there in the distance in front of us.\u201d",
    "Arthur followed the old man\u2019s finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out.",
    "It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a subliminal impression than anything one could put one\u2019s finger on.",
    "At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within.",
    "Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind.",
    "For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense.",
    "Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction.",
    "The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.",
    "\u201cThe Earth . . .\u201d whispered Arthur.",
    "\u201cWell, the Earth Mark Two in fact,\u201d said Slartibartfast cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re making a copy from our original blueprints.\u201d",
    "There was a pause.",
    "\u201cAre you trying to tell me,\u201d said Arthur, slowly and with control, \u201cthat you originally . . . made the Earth?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Slartibartfast. \u201cDid you ever go to a place . . .",
    "I think it was called Norway?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cno, I didn\u2019t.\u201d",
    "\u201cPity,\u201d said Slartibartfast, \u201cthat was one of mine.",
    "Won an award you know.",
    "Lovely crinkly edges.",
    "I was most upset to hear about its destruction.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou were upset!\u201d",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Five minutes later and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered so much.",
    "It was a quite shocking cock-up.\u201d",
    "\u201cHuh?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cThe mice were furious.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe mice were furious?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d said the old man mildly.",
    "\u201cYes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cAh, but they hadn\u2019t paid for it you see, had they?\u201d",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cwould it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\u201d",
    "For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence.",
    "Then the old man tried patiently to explain.",
    "\u201cEarthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice.",
    "It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we\u2019ve got to build another one.\u201d",
    "Only one word registered with Arthur.",
    "\u201cMice?\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIndeed Earthman.\u201d",
    "\u201cLook, sorry\u00d1are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?\u201d",
    "Slartibartfast coughed politely.",
    "\u201cEarthman,\u201d he said, \u201cit is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech.",
    "Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak.",
    "These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear.",
    "They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pandimensional beings.",
    "The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front.\u201d",
    "The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ve been experimenting on you I\u2019m afraid.\u201d",
    "Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared.",
    "\u201cAh no,\u201d he said, \u201cI see the source of the misunderstanding now.",
    "No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them.",
    "They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff.",
    "So what happened was that the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined.",
    "From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own . . .\u201d",
    "Arthur\u2019s voice tailed off.",
    "\u201cSuch subtlety . . .\u201d said Slartibartfast, \u201cone has to admire it.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cHow better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking.",
    "Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis,\u00d1if it\u2019s finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous.\u201d",
    "He paused for effect.",
    "\u201cYou see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pandimensional beings.",
    "Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year research programme . . .",
    "\u201cLet me tell you the whole story.",
    "It\u2019ll take a little time.\u201d",
    "\u201cTime,\u201d said Arthur weakly, \u201cis not currently one of my problems.\u201d",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born?",
    "Why do they die?",
    "Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?",
    "Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pandimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.",
    "And to this end they built themselves a stupendous supercomputer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off.",
    "It was the size of a small city.",
    "Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather.",
    "The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square.",
    "On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with briefcases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office.",
    "They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their briefcases and took out their leather-bound notebooks.",
    "Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.",
    "For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel.",
    "The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode.",
    "After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep.",
    "It said: \u201cWhat is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?\u201d",
    "Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.",
    "\u201cYour task, O Computer . . .\u201d began Fook.",
    "\u201cNo, wait a minute, this isn\u2019t right,\u201d said Lunkwill, worried. \u201cWe distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we\u2019re not making do with second best.",
    "Deep Thought,\u201d he addressed the computer, \u201care you not as we designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time?\u201d",
    "\u201cI described myself as the second greatest,\u201d intoned Deep Thought, \u201cand such I am.\u201d",
    "Another worried look passed between the two programmers.",
    "Lunkwill cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cThere must be some mistake,\u201d he said, \u201care you not a greater computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Milliard Gargantubrain?\u201d said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. \u201cA mere abacus\u00d1mention it not.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd are you not,\u201d said Fook leaning anxiously forward, \u201ca greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?\u201d",
    "\u201cA five-week sand blizzard?\u201d said Deep Thought haughtily. \u201cYou ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself?",
    "Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff.\u201d",
    "The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment.",
    "Then Lunkwill leaned forward again.",
    "\u201cBut are you not,\u201d he said, \u201ca more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler,\u201d said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r\u2019s, \u201ccould talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey\u00d1but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen what,\u201d asked Fook, \u201cis the problem?\u201d",
    "\u201cThere is no problem,\u201d said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones. \u201cI am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut the second?\u201d insisted Lunkwill. \u201cWhy do you keep saying the second?",

    "Fook was losing patience.",
    "He pushed his notebook aside and muttered, \u201cI think this is getting needlessly messianic.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou know nothing of future time,\u201d pronounced Deep Thought, \u201cand yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design.\u201d",
    "Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.",
    "\u201cCan we get on and ask the question?\u201d he said.",
    "Lunkwill motioned him to wait.",
    "\u201cWhat computer is this of which you speak?\u201d he asked.",

    "A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way.",

    "He experienced a moment\u2019s panic as he sailed straight through towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it.",
    "No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn\u2019t there.",
    "He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat.",
    "The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it.",
    "In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so.",
    "The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk\u2019s leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.",
    "Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited.",
    "\u201cThe time is nearly upon us,\u201d said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man\u2019s neck.",

    "Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck.",

    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said Deep Thought at last.",
    "\u201cEr . . .",
    "Good morning, O Deep Thought,\u201d said Loonquawl nervously, \u201cdo you have . . . er, that is . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cAn answer for you?\u201d interrupted Deep Thought majestically. \u201cYes.",
    "I have.\u201d",

    "\u201cYes.\u201d",
    "Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.",

    "\u201cIt was a tough assignment,\u201d said Deep Thought mildly.",
    "\u201cForty-two!\u201d yelled Loonquawl. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got to show for seven and a half million years\u2019 work?\u201d",

    "\u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s just Everything . . .",
    "Everything . . .\u201d offered Phouchg weakly.",
    "\u201cExactly!\u201d said Deep Thought. \u201cSo once you do know what the question actually is, you\u2019ll know what the answer means.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh terrific,\u201d muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear.",

    "\u201cI speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me,\u201d intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. \u201cA computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate\u00d1and yet I will design it for you.",

    "It gleamed like . . . it\u2019s impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does.",

    "He poked it and prodded it with his fingernail.",
    "It was very heavy and very slightly soft\u00d1he could mark it with his fingernail.",
    "It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold.",
    "\u201cTrillian and I came round a while ago,\u201d said Ford. \u201cWe shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us.",

    "\u201cSome people like the oddest things.\u201d",

    "Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked.",
    "\u201cVery pretty,\u201d said Zaphod petulantly.",
    "In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared.",
    "It flickered and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land.",
    "As with one voice they all went, \u201cYuch.\u201d",
    "The sea was purple.",
    "The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles\u00d1presumably terribly precious stones.",
    "The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks.",
    "Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassels.",
    "In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number.",
    "It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you.",
    "We are not proud.",
    "And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes.",

    "\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cYeah, OK,\u201d said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them.",
    "\u201cI figure this,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cWhatever happened to my mind, I did it.",
    "And I did it in such a way that it wouldn\u2019t be detected by the government screening tests.",
    "And I wasn\u2019t to know anything about it myself.",
    "Pretty crazy, right?\u201d",
    "The other two nodded in agreement.",
    "\u201cSo I reckon, what\u2019s so secret that I can\u2019t let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself?",
    "And the answer is I don\u2019t know.",
    "Obviously.",
    "But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess.",
    "When did I decide to run for President?",
    "Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx.",
    "You remember Yooden, Ford?\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ford, \u201che was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturan captain.",
    "He was a gas.",
    "He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter.",
    "Said you were the most amazing kid he\u2019d ever met.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d said Trillian.",
    "\u201cAncient history,\u201d said Ford, \u201cwhen we were kids together on Betelgeuse.",
    "The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions.",
    "The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them.",
    "There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defense shields known to Galactic science.",
    "They were real brutes of ships, and huge.",
    "In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun.",
    "\u201cOne day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one.",
    "On a tri-jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid.",
    "I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey.",
    "I went along for the ride because I\u2019d got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn\u2019t want him coming back with fake evidence.",
    "So what happens?",
    "We got in his tri-jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter I still don\u2019t know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers.",
    "A wilder thing I have not known.",
    "Lost me a year\u2019s pocket money.",
    "For what?",
    "Conkers.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cHe gave us food, booze\u00d1stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy\u00d1lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time.",
    "Then he teleported us back.",
    "Into the maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison.",
    "He was a cool guy.",
    "Went on to become President of the Galaxy.\u201d",
    "Zaphod paused.",
    "The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom.",
    "Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows.",
    "The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings.",
    "Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition.",
    "\u201cFord,\u201d said Zaphod quietly.",
    "\u201cYeah?\u201d",
    "\u201cJust before Yooden died he came to see me.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?",
    "You never told me.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat did he say?",
    "What did he come to see you about?\u201d",
    "\u201cHe told me about the Heart of Gold.",
    "It was his idea that I should steal it.\u201d",
    "\u201cHis idea?\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cand the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony.\u201d",
    "Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter.",
    "\u201cAre you telling me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.",
    "\u201cBut why?\u201d said Ford. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important about having it?\u201d",
    "\u201cDunno,\u201d said Zaphod, \u201cI think if I\u2019d consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed.",
    "I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you?\u201d",
    "\u201cHe was a hell of a talker.\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know.\u201d",
    "Zaphod shrugged.",
    "\u201cI mean, don\u2019t you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?\u201d asked Ford.",
    "Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds.",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets.",
    "Still,\u201d he added on further reflection, \u201cI can understand that.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t trust myself further than I could spit a rat.\u201d",
    "A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again.",
    "They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables and design awards.",
    "A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them.",
    "\u201cThe mice will see you now,\u201d he said.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "\u201cSo there you have it,\u201d said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study.",
    "He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over. \u201cDeep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed,\u201d added Arthur, not unbitterly.",

    "\u201cWell that\u2019s bureaucracy for you,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cYou know,\u201d said Arthur thoughtfully, \u201call this explains a lot of things.",

    "\u201cMaybe.",
    "Who cares?\u201d said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m old and tired,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied.",
    "Look at me: I design coastlines.",
    "I got an award for Norway.\u201d",
    "He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it.",

    "I\u2019ve been doing fjords in all my life.",
    "For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award.\u201d",

    "\u201cIn this replacement Earth we\u2019re building they\u2019ve given me Africa to do and of course I\u2019m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I\u2019m old-fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent.",
    "And they tell me it\u2019s not equatorial enough.",
    "Equatorial!\u201d He gave a hollow laugh. \u201cWhat does it matter?",

    "\u201cWhat were the first two?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh, probably just coincidences,\u201d said Slartibartfast carelessly.",
    "He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow.",
    "Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning.",
    "\u201cI seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u201d he muttered to himself.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said the old man mildly.",

    "For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said \u201cI seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u201d a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.",
    "The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time.",
    "A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl\u2019hurgs, resplendent in his black jeweled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G\u2019Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother.",
    "The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table.",
    "Unfortunately, in the Vl\u2019hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries.",
    "Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy\u00d1now positively identified as the source of the offending remark.",
    "For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across\u00d1which happened to be the Earth\u00d1where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.",
    "Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just life,\u201d they say.",
    "A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway.",
    "They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards.",
    "Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered.",
    "\u201cArthur!",
    "You\u2019re safe!\u201d a voice cried.",
    "\u201cAm I?\u201d said Arthur, rather startled. \u201cOh good.\u201d",
    "The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits.",
    "They were stuffing their faces.",
    "\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d demanded Arthur.",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, \u201cour guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us.",
    "Here,\u201d he said hoiking out a lump of evil-smelling meat from a bowl, \u201chave some Vegan Rhino\u2019s cutlet.",
    "It\u2019s delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.\u201d",
    "\u201cHosts?\u201d said Arthur. \u201cWhat hosts?",
    "I don\u2019t see any . . .\u201d",
    "A small voice said, \u201cWelcome to lunch, Earth creature.\u201d",
    "Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped.",
    "\u201cUgh!\u201d he said. \u201cThere are mice on the table!\u201d",
    "There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur.",
    "He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table.",
    "He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone.",
    "\u201cOh!\u201d he said, with sudden realization. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d said Trillian. \u201cArthur this is Benji mouse.\u201d",
    "\u201cHi,\u201d said one of the mice.",
    "His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch-sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass-like affair, and it moved forward slightly.",
    "\u201cAnd this is Frankie mouse.\u201d",
    "The other mouse said, \u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d and did likewise.",
    "Arthur gaped.",
    "\u201cBut aren\u2019t they . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d said Trillian, \u201cthey are the mice I brought with me from the Earth.\u201d",
    "She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug.",
    "\u201cCould you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?\u201d she said.",
    "Slartibartfast coughed politely.",
    "\u201cEr, excuse me,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYes, thank you Slartibartfast,\u201d said Benji mouse sharply, \u201cyou may go.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?",
    "Oh . . . er, very well,\u201d said the old man, slightly taken aback, \u201cI\u2019ll just go and get on with some of my fjords then.\u201d",
    "\u201cAh, well in fact that won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d said Frankie mouse. \u201cIt looks very much as if we won\u2019t be needing the new Earth any longer.\u201d He swivelled his pink little eyes. \u201cNot now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Slartibartfast, aghast. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean that!",
    "I\u2019ve got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!\u201d",
    "\u201cWell perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them,\u201d said Frankie, acidly.",
    "\u201cSkiing holiday!\u201d cried the old man. \u201cThose glaciers are works of art!",
    "Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines!",
    "It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!\u201d",
    "\u201cThank you Slartibartfast,\u201d said Benji firmly. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes sir,\u201d said the old man coldly, \u201cthank you very much.",
    "Well, goodbye Earthman,\u201d he said to Arthur, \u201chope the lifestyle comes together.\u201d",
    "With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room.",
    "Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say.",
    "\u201cNow,\u201d said Benji mouse, \u201cto business.\u201d",
    "Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together.",
    "\u201cTo business!\u201d they said.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said Benji.",
    "Ford looked round.",
    "\u201cSorry, I thought you were proposing a toast,\u201d he said.",
    "The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports.",
    "Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved forward to address Arthur.",
    "\u201cNow, Earth creature,\u201d he said, \u201cthe situation we have in effect is this.",
    "We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy?\u201d said Arthur, sharply.",
    "\u201cNo\u00d1we already thought of that one,\u201d said Frankie interrupting, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t fit the answer.",
    "Why?\u00d1Forty-Two . . . you see, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cI mean why have you been doing it?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said Frankie. \u201cWell, eventually just habit I think, to be brutally honest.",
    "And this is more or less the point\u00d1we\u2019re sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean?",
    "It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends.\u201d",
    "\u201cMagrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension,\u201d put in Benji.",
    "\u201cSince when,\u201d continued his murine colleague, \u201cwe have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we\u2019re very much inclined to take it.\u201d",
    "\u201cI would, wouldn\u2019t you Ford?\u201d said Zaphod promptingly.",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ford, \u201cjump at it, like a shot.\u201d",
    "Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to.",
    "\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to have a product you see,\u201d said Frankie, \u201cI mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other.\u201d",
    "Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur.",
    "\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cif they\u2019re just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it\u2019s Forty-two, then the show\u2019s probably quite short.",
    "No follow-up, you see.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have to have something that sounds good,\u201d said Benji.",
    "\u201cSomething that sounds good?\u201d exclaimed Arthur. \u201cAn Ultimate Question that sounds good?",
    "From a couple of mice?\u201d",
    "The mice bristled.",
    "\u201cWell, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I\u2019m afraid where you begin to suspect that if there\u2019s any real truth, it\u2019s that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs.",
    "And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise,\u201d said Frankie.",
    "\u201cBut . . .\u201d started Arthur, hopelessly.",
    "\u201cHey, will you get this, Earthman,\u201d interrupted Zaphod. \u201cYou are a last-generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?\u201d",
    "\u201cEr . . .\u201d",
    "\u201cSo your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer programme,\u201d said Ford, rather lucidly he thought.",
    "\u201cRight?\u201d said Zaphod.",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d said Arthur doubtfully.",
    "He wasn\u2019t aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything.",
    "He had always seen this as one of his problems.",
    "\u201cIn other words,\u201d said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain\u00d1so we want to buy it off you.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat, the question?\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d said Ford and Trillian.",
    "\u201cFor lots of money,\u201d said Zaphod.",
    "\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Frankie, \u201cit\u2019s the brain we want to buy.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat!\u201d",
    "\u201cI thought you said you could just read his brain electronically,\u201d protested Ford.",
    "\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Frankie, \u201cbut we\u2019d have to get it out first.",
    "It\u2019s got to be prepared.\u201d",
    "\u201cTreated,\u201d said Benji.",
    "\u201cDiced.\u201d",
    "\u201cThank you,\u201d shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror.",
    "\u201cIt could always be replaced,\u201d said Benji reasonably, \u201cif you think it\u2019s important.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, an electronic brain,\u201d said Frankie, \u201ca simple one would suffice.\u201d",
    "\u201cA simple one!\u201d wailed Arthur.",
    "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, \u201cyou\u2019d just have to program it to say What? and I don\u2019t understand and Where\u2019s the tea?\u00d1who\u2019d know the difference?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Arthur, backing away still further.",
    "\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something that Trillian did at that moment.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d notice the difference,\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cNo you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Frankie mouse, \u201cyou\u2019d be programmed not to.\u201d",
    "Ford made for the door.",
    "\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, mice old lads,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d",
    "\u201cI rather think we have to have a deal,\u201d said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing from their piping little voices in an instant.",
    "With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything.",
    "Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was dead weight\u00d1he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him.",
    "She screamed at him, but he just gaped.",
    "With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open.",
    "On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea.",
    "Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty.",
    "They charged.",
    "So\u00d1Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were.",
    "All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "\u201cEmergency!",
    "Emergency!\u201d blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea. \u201cHostile ship has landed on planet.",
    "Armed intruders in section 8A.",
    "Defense stations, defense stations!\u201d",
    "The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor.",
    "\u201cDamnation,\u201d muttered Frankie mouse, \u201call that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain.\u201d He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static.",
    "\u201cThe only thing we can do now,\u201d said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, \u201cis to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible.\u201d",
    "\u201cDifficult,\u201d said Frankie.",
    "He thought. \u201cHow about What\u2019s yellow and dangerous?\u201d",
    "Benji considered this for a moment.",
    "\u201cNo, no good,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t fit the answer.\u201d",
    "They sank into silence for a few seconds.",
    "\u201cAlright,\u201d said Benji. \u201cWhat do you get if you multiply six by seven?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo, no, too literal, too factual,\u201d said Frankie, \u201cwouldn\u2019t sustain the punters\u2019 interest.\u201d",
    "Again they thought.",
    "Then Frankie said: \u201cHere\u2019s a thought.",
    "How many roads must a man walk down?\u201d",
    "\u201cAh,\u201d said Benji. \u201cAha, now that does sound promising!\u201d He rolled the phrase around a little. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s excellent!",
    "Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all.",
    "How many roads must a man walk down?",
    "Forty-two.",
    "Excellent, excellent, that\u2019ll fox \u2018em.",
    "Frankie baby, we are made!\u201d",
    "They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.",
    "Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards.",
    "Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out.",
    "They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay.",
    "They glanced about wildly.",
    "\u201cWhich way do you reckon Zaphod?\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cAt a wild guess, I\u2019d say down here,\u201d said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall.",
    "As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall.",
    "A voice on a loud hailer said, \u201cOK Beeblebrox, hold it right there.",
    "We\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d",
    "\u201cCops!\u201d hissed Zaphod, and spun around in a crouch. \u201cYou want to try a guess at all, Ford?\u201d",
    "\u201cOK, this way,\u201d said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks.",
    "At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and spacesuited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!\u201d shouted the figure.",
    "\u201cSuits me fine!\u201d shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units.",
    "The others swerved in behind him.",
    "\u201cThere are two of them,\u201d said Trillian. \u201cWe\u2019re cornered.\u201d",
    "They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall.",
    "They held their breath and waited.",
    "Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously.",
    "\u201cHey, they\u2019re shooting at us,\u201d said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, \u201cI thought they said they didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah, I thought they said that,\u201d agreed Ford.",
    "Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment.",
    "\u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want to shoot us!\u201d and ducked again.",

    "After a moment a voice replied, \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy being a cop!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d whispered Ford in astonishment.",

    "\u201cI\u2019d have thought so.\u201d",
    "Ford shouted out, \u201cHey listen!",
    "I think we\u2019ve got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we\u2019d all find it easier to cope!\u201d",
    "Another pause, and then the loud hailer again.",
    "\u201cNow see here, guy,\u201d said the voice on the loud hailer, \u201cyou\u2019re not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we\u2019re a couple of intelligent caring guys that you\u2019d probably quite like if you met us socially!",
    "I don\u2019t go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some cops I could mention!",
    "I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd I write novels!\u201d chimed in the other cop. \u201cThough I haven\u2019t had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I\u2019m in a meeeean mood!\u201d",
    "Ford\u2019s eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. \u201cWho are these guys?\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cSo are you going to come quietly,\u201d shouted one of the cops again, \u201cor are you going to let us blast you out?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhich would you prefer?\u201d shouted Ford.",
    "A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them.",
    "The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity.",
    "When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness as the echoes died away.",
    "\u201cYou still there?\u201d called one of the cops.",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d they called back.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t enjoy doing that at all,\u201d shouted the other cop.",
    "\u201cWe could tell,\u201d shouted Ford.",
    "\u201cNow, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy?\u201d shouted Back Zaphod.",
    "\u201cBecause,\u201d shouted the cop, \u201cit\u2019s going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane!",
    "Now either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!\u201d",
    "\u201cBut that\u2019s crazy!\u201d cried Trillian. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d",
    "\u201cOh yes we would,\u201d shouted the cop, \u201cwouldn\u2019t we?\u201d he asked the other one.",
    "\u201cOh yes, we\u2019d have to, no question,\u201d the other one called back.",
    "\u201cBut why?\u201d demanded Trillian.",

    "\u201cI just don\u2019t believe these guys,\u201d muttered Ford, shaking his head.",
    "One cop shouted to the other, \u201cShall we shoot them again for a bit?\u201d",
    "\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d",
    "They let fly another electric barrage.",
    "The heat and noise was quite fantastic.",
    "Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate.",

    "\u201cRight,\u201d said Ford, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a look.\u201d",
    "He glanced round at the others.",
    "\u201cIs no one going to say, No you can\u2019t possibly, let me go instead?\u201d",
    "They all shook their heads.",
    "\u201cOh well,\u201d he said, and stood up.",
    "For a moment, nothing happened.",
    "Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.",
    "Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer.",
    "Cautiously he stepped out into the open.",
    "Still nothing happened.",
    "Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited figure of one of the cops.",
    "He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground.",
    "Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man.",
    "No one else was anywhere to be seen.",
    "This struck Ford as being extremely odd.",
    "Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one.",
    "The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers.",
    "He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance.",
    "The cop was quite clearly dead.",
    "A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa\u00d1he was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea.",
    "The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up.",
    "Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment.",
    "These miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the sub-etha.",
    "Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of.",
    "He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously.",
    "He called the others over to look.",
    "They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s get shot out of this hole,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cIf whatever I\u2019m supposed to be looking for is here, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He grabbed the second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others.",
    "He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away.",
    "The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast.",
    "It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel.",
    "The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls.",
    "It said, This is probably the best button to press.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight.",
    "Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land.",
    "R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late.",
    "It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor.",
    "Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death.",
    "R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.",
    "The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own.",
    "Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship.",
    "Beside it stood another one.",
    "It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous shark-like affair, slate-green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness.",
    "The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected.",
    "It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxiated in a smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground.",
    "It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead.",
    "Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious\u00d1a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead.",
    "In his experience the Universe simply didn\u2019t work like that.",
    "The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity.",
    "Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship.",
    "As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust.",
    "\u201cMarvin!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t feel you have to take any notice of me, please,\u201d came a muffled drone.",
    "\u201cBut how are you, metalman?\u201d said Ford.",
    "\u201cVery depressed.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Marvin, \u201cI\u2019ve never been there.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy,\u201d said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, \u201care you lying face down in the dust?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective way of being wretched,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes you do, everybody does.",
    "It\u2019s part of the shape of the Universe.",
    "I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me.",
    "Even robots hate me.",
    "If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away.\u201d",
    "He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction.",
    "\u201cThat ship hated me,\u201d he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft.",
    "\u201cThat ship?\u201d said Ford in sudden excitement. \u201cWhat happened to it?",
    "Do you know?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt hated me because I talked to it.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou talked to it?\u201d exclaimed Ford. \u201cWhat do you mean you talked to it?\u201d",
    "\u201cSimple.",
    "I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed.",
    "I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,\u201d said Marvin.",
    "\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d pressed Ford.",
    "\u201cIt committed suicide,\u201d said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold.",
    "Unknown",
    "Unknown",
    "That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
    "Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he\u2019d better start finding out something about it.",
    "He came across this entry.",
    "It said: \u201cThe History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.",
    "\u201cFor instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?\u201d",
    "He got no further before the ship\u2019s intercom buzzed into life.",
    "\u201cHey Earthman?",
    "You hungry kid?\u201d said Zaphod\u2019s voice.",
    "\u201cEr, well yes, a little peckish I suppose,\u201d said Arthur.",
    "\u201cOK baby, hold tight,\u201d said Zaphod. \u201cWe\u2019ll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\u201d"
